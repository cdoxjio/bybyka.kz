This feature allows you to define different media bit rate settings for different network locations based on the IP address ranges. Here are the steps to accomplish your task: ? Create a new network roaming policy with the desired media bit rate settings. For example, you can use the following PowerShell cmdlet to create a policy named “MiamiPolicy” with a maximum bit rate of 1000 Kbps for audio and video: New-CsTeamsNetworkRoamingPolicy -Identity \"MiamiPolicy\" -MaxMediaBitRateKb 1000 ?

    "answers": [
      "Teams advisor",

    "correct": [
      3
    ],
    "explanation": "According to the Microsoft documentation1, you can use the Teams usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center to get an overview of the usage activity in Teams. This includes the number of active users, channels, guests, and post messages via chat and conversations to know how many users in each team are actively using Teams to communicate and collaborate. However, this report only shows the last 7 or 28 days of activity of teams, which may not be enough to identify inactive teams over a longer period. Alternatively, you can use PowerShell scripts to generate activity reports that check the audit records of inactive teams and provide an HTML report file based on SharePoint site activity in the group’s document library in the past 90 days and conversations that occurred in the mailbox in the past year2. However, this method requires writing complex and time- consuming PowerShell commands, which may not be feasible for administrators who need to produce multiple reports on a daily basis. Another method to detect inactive teams in your Teams environment is by setting an expiration policy for the associated group in Azure AD. This notifies the owner of the team or group by sending an email to renew or delete the team after specified days if no activity is detected3. However, this method also has some drawbacks, such as: ? The owner may fail to notice the email or renew the team within the timeline of the configured policy, resulting in the team being deleted automatically and not being restorable after 30 days? The expiration policy applies to all Microsoft 365 groups in an Azure AD organization, not just Teams. This may affect other groups that are not related to Teams? The expiration policy requires Azure AD Premium licenses for the members of all groups to which the policy is applied. Therefore, based on this information, the correct answer is D. the Teams usage report. This report is the most straightforward and accessible way to find inactive teams in Microsoft Teams, even though it has some limitations. The other options are either not related to finding inactive teams (Teams advisor) or require additional licenses or permissions (the Office 365 Groups activity report and the Teams user activity report).",

An emergency address is a civic address—the physical or street address of a place of business for your organization. It is used to route emergency calls to the appropriate dispatch authorities and to assist in locating the emergency caller. After you add an emergency address, you need to assign a phone number to it. You can assign either a user number or a service number. A user number is assigned to a specific user in your organization who makes and receives phone calls. A service number is used for services such as Audio Conferencing (for dial- in numbers), auto attendants, or call queues. To assign a phone number to an emergency address, you need to modify the location for each phone number. You can do this by using the Microsoft Teams admin center or PowerShell. For example, to modify the location for a user number by using PowerShell, you can use the Set-CsOnlineVoiceUser cmdlet with the -LocationID parameter2.",

In the report details page, you can see various metrics and filters for the selected report. You can also customize the report by adding or removing dimensions and measures? To see whether Teams calls use TCP or UDP, you need to add Transport Protocol as a dimension to the report. To do this, select Add dimension, and then select Transport Protocol from the drop-down list? The report will show the distribution of TCP and UDP usage for Teams calls based on the selected report type.",

    "correct": [
      3
    ],
    "explanation": "According to the Microsoft documentation1, you can use the Teams usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center to get an overview of the usage activity in Teams. This includes the number of active users, channels, guests, and post messages via chat and conversations to know how many users in each team are actively using Teams to communicate and collaborate. However, this report only shows the last 7 or 28 days of activity of teams, which may not be enough to identify inactive teams over a longer period. Alternatively, you can use PowerShell scripts to generate activity reports that check the audit records of inactive teams and provide an HTML report file based on SharePoint site activity in the group’s document library in the past 90 days and conversations that occurred in the mailbox in the past year2. However, this method requires writing complex and time- consuming PowerShell commands, which may not be feasible for administrators who need to produce multiple reports on a daily basis. Another method to detect inactive teams in your Teams environment is by setting an expiration policy for the associated group in Azure AD. This notifies the owner of the team or group by sending an email to renew or delete the team after specified days if no activity is detected3. However, this method also has some drawbacks, such as: ? The owner may fail to notice the email or renew the team within the timeline of the configured policy, resulting in the team being deleted automatically and not being restorable after 30 days? The expiration policy applies to all Microsoft 365 groups in an Azure AD organization, not just Teams. This may affect other groups that are not related to Teams? The expiration policy requires Azure AD Premium licenses for the members of all groups to which the policy is applied. Therefore, based on this information, the correct answer is D. the Teams usage report. This report is the most straightforward and accessible way to find inactive teams in Microsoft Teams, even though it has some limitations. The other options are either not related to finding inactive teams (Teams advisor) or require additional licenses or permissions (the Office 365 Groups activity report and the Teams user activity report).",

An emergency address is a civic address—the physical or street address of a place of business for your organization. It is used to route emergency calls to the appropriate dispatch authorities and to assist in locating the emergency caller. After you add an emergency address, you need to assign a phone number to it. You can assign either a user number or a service number. A user number is assigned to a specific user in your organization who makes and receives phone calls. A service number is used for services such as Audio Conferencing (for dial- in numbers), auto attendants, or call queues. To assign a phone number to an emergency address, you need to modify the location for each phone number. You can do this by using the Microsoft Teams admin center or PowerShell. For example, to modify the location for a user number by using PowerShell, you can use the Set-CsOnlineVoiceUser cmdlet with the -LocationID parameter2.",

Endpoint Reports show information about the devices and networks used in Teams calls and meetings, such as device name, manufacturer, model, OS version, network type, IP address, and transport protocol (TCP or UDP). To access Endpoint Reports in CQD, you need to follow these steps3: ? Sign in to CQD with your admin account? In the left navigation pane, select Reports > Endpoint? In the report list page, select one of the predefined endpoint reports, such as Endpoint by Manufacturer or Endpoint by Network Type? In the report details page, you can see various metrics and filters for the selected report. You can also customize the report by adding or removing dimensions and measures? To see whether Teams calls use TCP or UDP, you need to add Transport Protocol as a dimension to the report. To do this, select Add dimension, and then select Transport Protocol from the drop-down list? The report will show the distribution of TCP and UDP usage for Teams calls based on the selected report type.",

This feature allows you to define different media bit rate settings for different network locations based on the IP address ranges. Here are the steps to accomplish your task: ? Create a new network roaming policy with the desired media bit rate settings. For example, you can use the following PowerShell cmdlet to create a policy named “MiamiPolicy” with a maximum bit rate of 1000 Kbps for audio and video: New-CsTeamsNetworkRoamingPolicy -Identity \"MiamiPolicy\" -MaxMediaBitRateKb 1000 ? Assign the network roaming policy to the network range of the Miami office. You can use the following PowerShell cmdlet to assign the policy to the 10.10.10.0/24 network range: New-CsTeamsNetworkRoamingPolicyAssignment -PolicyName \"MiamiPolicy\" - IPAddressRange \"10.10.10.0/24\" ? Verify that the policy is applied correctly by using the Get- CsTeamsNetworkRoamingPolicyAssignment cmdlet.

In the report details page, you can see various metrics and filters for the selected report. You can also customize the report by adding or removing dimensions and measures?

    "correct": [
      3
    ],
    "explanation": "According to the Microsoft documentation1, you can use the Teams usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center to get an overview of the usage activity in Teams. This includes the number of active users, channels, guests, and post messages via chat and conversations to know how many users in each team are actively using Teams to communicate and collaborate. However, this report only shows the last 7 or 28 days of activity of teams, which may not be enough to identify inactive teams over a longer period. Alternatively, you can use PowerShell scripts to generate activity reports that check the audit records of inactive teams and provide an HTML report file based on SharePoint site activity in the group’s document library in the past 90 days and conversations that occurred in the mailbox in the past year2. However, this method requires writing complex and time- consuming PowerShell commands, which may not be feasible for administrators who need to produce multiple reports on a daily basis. Another method to detect inactive teams in your Teams environment is by setting an expiration policy for the associated group in Azure AD. This notifies the owner of the team or group by sending an email to renew or delete the team after specified days if no activity is detected3. However, this method also has some drawbacks, such as: ? The owner may fail to notice the email or renew the team within the timeline of the configured policy, resulting in the team being deleted automatically and not being restorable after 30 days? The expiration policy applies to all Microsoft 365 groups in an Azure AD organization, not just Teams. This may affect other groups that are not related to Teams? The expiration policy requires Azure AD Premium licenses for the members of all groups to which the policy is applied. Therefore, based on this information, the correct answer is D. the Teams usage report. This report is the most straightforward and accessible way to find inactive teams in Microsoft Teams, even though it has some limitations. The other options are either not related to finding inactive teams (Teams advisor) or require additional licenses or permissions (the Office 365 Groups activity report and the Teams user activity report).",

After you add an emergency address, you need to assign a phone number to it. You can assign either a user number or a service number. A user number is assigned to a specific user in your organization who makes and receives phone calls. A service number is used for services such as Audio Conferencing (for dial- in numbers), auto attendants, or call queues. To assign a phone number to an emergency address, you need to modify the location for each phone number. You can do this by using the Microsoft Teams admin center or PowerShell.
